Changelog
---------

Version 2.3.0 (2020-08-15)
- Reworked medium section and EEE support to resolve problems with connection establishment and stability.
- Added option to supply a fallback MAC.
- Updated Linux sources to 8.047.04 and added support for new family members

Version 2.2.2 (2018-01-21)
- Force ASPM state to disabled/enabled according to the config parameter setting.
- Requires 10.12 or newer.

Version 2.2.1 (2016-03-12):
- Updated underlying linux sources from Realtek to 8.041.00.
- Added support for RTL8111H
- Improved media selection (flow control and EEE can be switched via media selection).
- Implemented Apple’s polled receive driver model (RXPOLL).

Version 2.0.0 (2015-06-21):
 - Uses Apple's private driver interface introduced with 10.8.
 - Supports packet scheduling with QFQ.
 - Please note that 2.0.0 is identical to 2.0.0d2. Only the version number has changed.

Version 1.2.3 (2014-08-23):
- Reworked TSO4 and added support for TSO6.

Version 1.2.2 (2014-08-14):
- ​Added an option to disable Active State Power Management (ASPM, default disabled) as ASPM seems to result in unstable operation of some chipsets.
- Resolved a problem with Link Aggregation after reboot.
- Added a workaround for the multicast filter bug of chipset 17 (RTL8111F) which prevented Bonjour from working properly.

Version 1.2.0 (2014-04-24):
- Updated underlying linux sources from Realtek to 8.037.00.
- Improved interrupt mitigate to use a less aggressive value for 10/100 MBit connections.

Version 1.1.3 (2013-11-29):
- Improved transmit queue handling made it possible to reduce CPU load during packet transmission.
- Improved deadlock detection logic in order to avoid false positives due to lost interrupts.

Version 1.1.2 (2013-08-03):
- Improved SMB performance in certain configurations.
- Faster browsing of large shares.

Version 1.1.1 (2013-06-29):
- Remove ethernet CRC from received packets to fix rx checksum offload.

Version 1.1.0 (2013-06-08):
- Support for TCP/IPv6 and UDP/IPv6 checksum offload added (can be disabled in Info.plist).
- Maximum size of the scatter-gather-list has been increased from 24 to 40 segments to resolve performance issues with TSO4 when offloading large packets which are highly fragmented.
- TSO4 can be disabled in Info.plist without rebuild.
- Statistics gathering has been improved to deliver more detailed information (resource shortages, transmitter resets, transmitter interrupt count).
- The interrupt mitigate settings has been changed to improve performance with SMB and to reduce CPU load.
- Configuration option added to allow for user defined interrupt mitigate settings without rebuild.

Version 1.0.4 (2013-05-04):
- Moved setLinkStatus(kIONetworkLinkValid) from start() to enable(). Cleaned up getDescCommand().

Version 1.0.3 (2013-04-25):
- The issue after a reboot from Windows has been eliminated.

Version 1.0.2 (2013-04-22):
- Added support for rx checksum offload of TCP and UDP over IPv6.

Version 1.0.1 (2013-03-31):
- Improved behavior when rx checksum offload isn't working properly.
- Adds the chipset's model name to IORegistry so that it will show up in System Profiler.
